# Open Publish: the Quartz starter

The site half of Open Publish. This repository builds a website from a snapshot
published to your object storage by the Obsidian plugin.

**Your notes are never committed here.** They are fetched at build time and live
only in the build machine's working directory.

## Use it

1. **Use this template → Create a new repository.** Do not clone; there is
   nothing to run locally.
2. Connect it to Cloudflare Pages (or Workers Builds, Netlify, or Vercel).
3. Build command: `npm run build`. Output directory: `public`.

   On **Workers Builds** the output settings come from `wrangler.jsonc` instead,
   which is already here. Change the `name` in it to match your Worker, or the
   build fails. Every other host ignores that file, including Pages, because it
   carries no `pages_build_output_dir`.
4. Add these environment variables, using a **read-only** storage token:

   | Variable | Value |
   |---|---|
   | `OP_ENDPOINT` | `https://<account-id>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com` |
   | `OP_BUCKET` | your bucket |
   | `OP_REGION` | `auto` for R2 |
   | `OP_ACCESS_KEY_ID` | read-only key ID |
   | `OP_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | read-only secret (mark encrypted) |
   | `OP_PREFIX` | optional, if the plugin uses a key prefix |
   | `OP_SITE_URL` | your site address. Required on Workers Builds, which reports none, and on any custom domain |
   | `OP_SITE_ROOT` | optional, for a site served from a sub-path, e.g. `/notes` |

   The build works out the address from the host's own variable where there is
   one (`CF_PAGES_URL`, `URL`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL`). Workers Builds
   sets none, so the build stops and asks for `OP_SITE_URL` rather than quietly
   producing a site addressed as `example.com`.

Full walkthrough: [docs/setup-cloudflare.md](../../docs/setup-cloudflare.md).

## What the build does

```
npm run build
├── scripts/fetch-content.mjs   snapshot → content/
├── scripts/build-site.mjs      Quartz → public/
└── scripts/finalize.mjs        marker, headers, redirects
```

**`fetch-content.mjs`**

1. Reads `current.json`, then `snapshots/<id>.json`.
2. Downloads each object, **verifies its SHA-256**, and fails the build on a
   mismatch. Corrupt content must never reach the live site.
3. Writes files at their site slug, so URLs and paths agree.
4. Rewrites links using the snapshot's resolved index: published targets become
   real links, unpublished and unresolved ones become plain text.
5. Writes `op-site.ts` from the snapshot's site options.
6. Generates an index page if no published note claims the site root.

**`build-site.mjs`** runs Quartz. The published template *is* a Quartz fork, so
it builds the `quartz/` folder already in the repository. (The script also
supports cloning Quartz at a pinned ref, which is how the overlay is developed
before assembly.)

## Licence and attribution

This template contains [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) by
jackyzha0, used under the MIT licence; `LICENSE.txt` is Quartz's and stays as
it is. The Open Publish additions (`scripts/`, `op-site.ts` and the two config
files) are MIT as well.

## This repository is built on Quartz

That is deliberate, and it is what makes the following work:

- **Every Quartz guide applies to you directly.** `quartz/styles/custom.scss`
  and all 27 components are right here, so any Quartz tutorial, doc page or
  forum answer can be followed as written.
- **Builds are fast and self-contained.** Dependencies are cached by your host
  against the root lockfile, and no build depends on GitHub or the npm registry
  being reachable.
- **Node is pinned.** `.node-version` comes from Quartz, which needs Node 22+.

### Updating Quartz

You do not have to. A pinned version keeps working indefinitely, and most people
never touch this.

When you do want a newer Quartz, note that **"Use this template" starts your
repository at a single commit**: GitHub does not copy history into a
template-derived repo. So point it at Quartz yourself, once:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/v4 --allow-unrelated-histories
```

`--allow-unrelated-histories` is needed the first time precisely because the
template gave you a fresh history. Afterwards a plain `git merge upstream/v4`
works.

Conflicts land in `quartz.config.ts` and `quartz.layout.ts`, the files you are
meant to own. Keep your versions of those, plus `scripts/` and `op-site.ts`.

This is the one part of Open Publish that needs a terminal, and only if you opt
into it.

### Customising

- **Colours, fonts, plugins**: `quartz.config.ts`
- **Custom CSS**: `quartz/styles/custom.scss`
- **Layout and components**: `quartz.layout.ts`, and `quartz/components/`
- **Do not edit `op-site.ts`**: regenerated each build from your Obsidian settings

**`finalize.mjs`** runs *after* the generator, because generators clear their
output directory. It writes:

- `public/_publish.json`: the snapshot ID, which the plugin polls to know the
  deploy is live
- `public/_headers`: `Cache-Control: no-store` on that marker, so a CDN cannot
  make a stale snapshot look live
- `public/_redirects`: from renamed notes, capped at the 2,000-rule platform
  limit

It also fails the build loudly on an empty output directory, more than 19,000
files, or any asset over 25 MiB, all cases where the deploy would otherwise
succeed and the site would be quietly broken.

## Customising

- **Theme, fonts, colours, plugins**: `quartz.config.ts`, yours to edit.
- **Layout and components**: `quartz.layout.ts`, which reads the site toggles
  from `op-site.ts`.
- **Do not edit `op-site.ts`.** It is regenerated on every build from what you
  set in Obsidian.

## Tests

```bash
npm run test:starter   # unit tests for the fetch/rewrite/finalize scripts
npm run verify         # full pipeline against a fake bucket, then a real Quartz build
```

`test:starter` rather than `test` because `npm test` belongs to Quartz.

Covers the link rewriter, the signer (cross-checked against the plugin's, so the
two cannot drift), and the whole build pipeline run as real subprocesses against
a local HTTP server standing in for a bucket.
